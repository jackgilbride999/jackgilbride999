### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jack, and I'm a software engineer.

My GitHub profile is mostly a graveyard of old assignments and projects worked on during my years at Trinity College Dublin (2017-2022). But who knows, I may come back and make some publicly accessible personal projects soon!

In my repositories you will find work in: Java, Haskell, C, C++, C#, HTML / CSS, JavaScript, Python, Prolog, Assembly, VHDL, and some of the interesting frameworks and libraries utilizing these languages!

### Contact Me!
You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackgilbride/).
