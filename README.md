### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jack, and I'm currently in my final year of an integrated B.A./MCS Computer Science degree at Trinity College Dublin.

I use GitHub to host and version control assignments, college projects and personal projects. In my repositories you will find work in: Java, C, C++, C#, HTML / CSS, JavaScript, Python, Haskell, Prolog, Assembly, VHDL, and some of the interesting frameworks and libraries utilizing these languages!
