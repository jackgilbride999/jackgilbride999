### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Jack Gilbride** and I am an Integrated Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin. I am currently in my fourth year of the five year Computer Science program, working towards a B.A. (Moderatorship) Honors Bachelor Degree at the end of fourth year, and an M.C.S. at the end of fifth year. 

I am currently seeking an **internship** in the area of Software Engineering / Development, from February until the end of summer 2021.

**GitHub** is my preferred host for version control. I use it to version control assignments, college projects and personal projects. 

Languages that you will find in my repositories include: ***Java*** (plus Processing, JUnit), ***C*** (plus PThreads, OpenMP, Intrinsics), ***C++*** (plus OpenGL) ***C#*** (plus Universal Windows Platform), ***HTML / CSS***, ***JavaScript*** (plus Node, Express, React), ***Python***, ***Haskell***, ***Prolog***, ***Assembly*** (ARM Assembly, IA32, x64), ***VHDL***, ***Flex & Bison*** and ***SQL***.

### Repositories in Progress
These are repositories for coursework that I am currently working on.
- [Functional Programming](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Functional-Programming)
- [Computer Graphics](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Computer-Graphics)

### Repositories that I'm Proud of
Here are links to some repositories that I am proud of working on on GitHub.
- [Telecommunications](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Telecommunications): Four **Java** projects exploring different concepts in Telecommunications, at different levels of the protocol stack. A simulation of a **Publish-Subscribe** protocol, a custom implementation of the **OpenFlow** Software Defined Networking protocol, a Web **Proxy Server** and functionality for a **Secure Social** Application. Each project contains a nice README and a report on the theory, implementation and findings from that project. Additionally the repository contains a IEEE-style research paper on **Named Data Networking**.
- [Easy Annotator](https://github.com/CSU33013-SWENG-Group-9/Easy-Annotator): A video annotation tool developed for **IBM Research** and the **Mater Hospital**. The project was built in **React** and allows the user to upload a video and mark **regions of interest** on it. These regions of interest can be annotated with labels (e.g. canerous, benign) and comments. Once all regions are marked an annotated, the project allows for export of the annotations in a **JSON** format agreed with IBM research. This JSON is used by IBM to train their machine learning algorithm to identify areas of interest and whether they are cancerous or benign.
- [HoloNav](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/HoloNav): A **HoloLens** application to guide the user to their desired destination using **augmented reality**. Google Maps currently has this feature, but this HoloLens project was created before Google rolled out the feature! The user **verbally** specifies their desired destination, and the app draws a line along the **route**, from the user to the destination, in augmented reality. The user can follow this line to the destination, aided by a **minimap** in the bottom corner of their vision, which shows their position on the map.
- [Yelp Visualization Project](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Yelp-Visualization-Project): A Java **Processing** project to visualize a **dataset** of Yelp reviews, businesses and users. Plenty of **frontend** features including graphs, charts, maps, scrollable screens, star levels, images etc. This was a first year project originally version controlled with Subversion, so some work is required to get it up and running on a local machine.
- [Solidworks Project](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Solidworks-Project): An old project at this stage, but still one I'm happy with! Leaving Certificate Design & Communications project, using **Solidworks** to create objects along with **orthographic**, exploded, pictorial and photorealistic views.
