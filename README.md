### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Jack Gilbride** and I am an Integrated Computer Science student at Trinity College Dublin. I am currently in my fourth year of the five year Computer Science program, working towards a B.A. (Moderatorship) Honors Bachelor Degree at the end of fourth year, and an M.C.S. at the end of fifth year. 

I am currently seeking an **internship** in the area of Software Engineering / Development, from February until the end of summer 2021.

**GitHub** is my preferred host for version control. I use it to version control assignments, college projects and personal projects. 

#### Languages Used in My Repositories
- Java (plus Processing, JUnit)
- C (plus PThreads, OpenMP, Intrinsics)
- C++ (plus OpenGL)
- C# (plus Universal Windows Platform)
- HTML / CSS
- JavaScript (plus Node, Express, React)
- Python
- Haskell
- Prolog
- Assembly (ARM Assembly, IA32, x64)
- VHDL
- Flex & Bison
- SQL

### Repositories in Progress
These are repositories for coursework that I am currently working on.
- [Functional Programming](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Functional-Programming)
- [Computer Graphics](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Computer-Graphics)

### Repositories that I'm Proud of
Here are links to some repositories that I am proud of working on on GitHub.
- [Telecommunications](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Telecommunications): Four Java projects exploring different concepts in Telecommunications, at different levels of the protocol stack. A simulation of a Publish Subscribe protocol, a custom implementation of the OpenFlow Software Defined Networking protocol, a Web Proxy Server and functionality for a Secure Social Application. Each project contains a nice README and a report on the theory, implementation and findings from that project. Additionally the repository contains a IEEE-style research paper on Named Data Networking.
- [Easy Annotator](https://github.com/CSU33013-SWENG-Group-9/Easy-Annotator): A video annotation tool developed for IBM Research and the Mater Hospital. The project was built in React and allows the user to upload a video and mark regions of interest on it. These regions of interest can be annotated with labels (e.g. canerous, benign) and comments. Once all regions are marked an annotated, the project allows for export of the annotations in a JSON format agreed with IBM research. This JSON is used by IBM to train their machine learning algorithm to identify areas of interest and whether they are cancerous or benign.
- [HoloNav](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/HoloNav)
- [Yelp Visualization Project](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Yelp-Visualization-Project)
- [Solidworks Project](https://github.com/jackgilbride999/Solidworks-Project)
